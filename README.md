# Credit_Card_Defaulter_Project
### Problem statement 
A Card issuing Bank has over issued its cash and credit card in-order-to increase its market share, even to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and cash– card debts. The crisis caused the blow to consumer finance confidence and it is a big challenge for both banks and cardholders. From the perspective of risk control, estimating the probability of default will be more meaningful than classifying customers into the binary results – risky and non-risky.
